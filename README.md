Don't Use Mouse. It's a K2M (Key to Mouse) app that binds mouse actions to wasd + q,e + some modifier buttons, so you won't have to move your hand each time you need to use your cursor.

Usage:
  Double Alt: on/off
  when the mouse mode is 'on':
    WASD: move cursor
    Q: left click
    E: right click
    Hold Shift: Accelerate
    Hold Alt: Percise Mode
F6: extra left click button.
