K2M is a program that translates keyboard keys to mouse input, so that you can make fast changes in code or text without moving your hand.

Usage:

    Caps Lock: Hold/Switch: bHoldCapsLock in config.ini (Shift + Caps Lock: Simulates CapsLock action)
    
    WASD: move cursor

    J/Q: left click
    K/E: right click
    
    Hold Shift/Alt: Accelerate

    Z: Back or LeftArrowKey depends on bUseArrows in config.ini 
    X: Forward
    C: Middle Mouse Button



* If the mouse does not work properly, try using Ctrl+Alt+Delete -> cancel (this reinitiates the input system, which makes the mouse work).
* The app has less priority than system applications (example: you can't use it in task manager).
